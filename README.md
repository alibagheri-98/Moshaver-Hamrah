Konkur, an entrance exam in Iran with nearly one million participants, traditionally involved advisers providing in-person guidance to students on effective study methods. However, with the emergence of COVID-19, face-to-face meetings became impossible. To address this challenge, we created an app using flutter, enabling online advising and ensuring continued support for students.

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.

The features of our app:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: To ensure easy navigation for students and advisors.

2. **Scheduling**: Allow both students and advisors to schedule advising sessions at their convenience. Implemented a calendar or booking system within the app.

3. **Messaging**: Included a messaging feature that allows students to ask questions or seek guidance outside of scheduled sessions. Real-time chat can be very helpful.

4. **Content Sharing**: Enabled the sharing of study materials, resources, and documents within the app.

5. **Notifications**: Implemented push notifications to remind students and advisors about scheduled sessions and important updates.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Created a system for students to provide feedback on the advising sessions and the app's functionality. Continuous improvement is crucial.

7. **Security and Privacy**: The app complies with privacy regulations and that all data, especially personal information, is securely handled and protected.
